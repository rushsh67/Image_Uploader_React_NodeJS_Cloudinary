- You can see demo project on https://file-upload-client.vercel.app 

- It was very learnigful experience, learned about API end-points, proxy, environment variables, cors and express.

- I have learned lots things like file handling over request, API integrations and image data, formdata.
- And now I can make API endpoints that can be accessed by anyone or specific origins as per requirement of project.
- Improved Knowledge about pushing projects to productions and the huge diffrences between both environments(i.e. developement and production).
